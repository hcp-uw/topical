# Topical - Making research accessible 

## Goals

Research papers are a cornerstone of science, but they are written with other experts in mind. They also often go unnoticed, getting little to no eyes on them, which is knowledge that is hidden from the public conscience. Topical aims to solve both of these problems by making research papers easily digestible and easily accessible. 

## Features

### Discover
The app will allow users to scroll through research papers, or 'topics.' Each topic has an easily readable title, and when selected displays an AI generated summary of the main points of the research paper. Each topic also includes a link to the original source. 

### Personalization
Since no algorithm can accurately objectify a human's needs, we will allow the user to adjust their settings to get the most interesting results, including filtering the topics by category. The user will also be able to 'like' topics to show more similar content.

### Search
The search page will allow users to search for specific topics based on their titles (both Topical titles and the titles of the original papers) and authors. 

### Account Features
The app will use an account based system, which allows the app to avoid sending you the same topics multiple times. This will also be the basis of future features like likes and comments.
